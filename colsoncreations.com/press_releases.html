											Talk about all in the family. Sean 
											Colson’s father, Frank Colson, is a 
											renowned sculptor and instructor. 
											His mother, Diana Colson, is a 
											writer, composer and filmmaker. Sean 
											grew up in Sarasota. After 
											graduating from Sarasota High School 
											in 1979, he started a bronze casting 
											supply business and a bronze 
											foundry. He reproduces, repairs and 
											restores historic Sarasota statuary, 
											and also designs original works 
											using bronze and other materials. He 
											and his wife, Marina, offer art and 
											cultural tours around the world.<strong>
											<br />
											<br />
											I hear you started making art an 
											early age. </strong>I sold my first 
											illustration for a nickel in 1965. 
											Within an hour, &nbsp; I sold five 
											drawings, just enough to buy a 
											Matchbox car. Before the summer was 
											over, I was able to purchase a fleet 
											of cars. Two years later, at 7, I 
											participated in a father-and-son 
											exhibition in Sarasota — and John D. 
											MacDonald purchased one of my 
											drawings!<strong> <br />
											<br />
											How would you describe your latest 
											art? </strong>It’s pretty much the 
											same style as when I was a kid: 
											comical, playful, imaginative 
											fantasy figures and machines.
											<strong><br />
											<br />
											How did you become interested in 
											working in bronze? </strong>I 
											started manipulating clay and wax as 
											a child. My father had — and still 
											has — a ceramic and bronze-casting 
											studio next to our house. When I was 
											little, I played with these 
											materials. As I grew older, I helped 
											my father with his work and learned 
											to cast my own pieces, refining my 
											style along the way. In Elizabethan 
											times, I would have been considered 
											a boy apprentice. <strong>Are you 
											involved in any public art projects?</strong> 
											I cast large bronzes for projects 
											created by other artists in the 
											United States and Canada. Most 
											recently, I helped design the 
											Ringling Isles statuary urn 
											commemorating John Ringling. <strong>
											<br />
											<br />
											Your wife, Marina, is also an 
											artist. How does that work? </strong>
											We call ourselves the “togetherness 
											team.” We collaborate really well 
											together. <strong><br />
											<br />
											What are your principal artistic 
											influences?</strong> Dr. Seuss, the 
											movies “Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang” and 
											“Yellow Submarine,” and the town of 
											Woodstock, N.Y. What are your goals 
											for Sarasota this coming season? I 
											hope to have an exhibition of small 
											bronze sculptures. I’m also striving 
											to finish text and drawings for two 
											books, “The Book of Love and Peace” 
											and “Baby, Peace!” (Sample drawings 
											can be seen at 
											www.ColsonCreations.com.) I also 
											plan on offering classes in creating 
											bronze sculpture. <br />

														Sean Colson</span></a> 
														was raised in the 
														Sarasota art scene. Born 
														in Tallahassee, his 
														parents brought him to 
														Sarasota at the age of 
														four. The year was 1964, 
														and the family had 
														purchased the original 
														home of famed 
														watercolorist Hilton 
														Leech because it came 
														with a licensed art 
														studio on the property. 
														His father, sculptor 
														Frank Colson, soon set 
														up Colson School of Art 
														on Hillview Street.<br />
														<br />
														By age five, Sean and 
														his brother Kevin were 
														making illustrations and 
														drawings of cars and 
														selling them in the 
														front yard for 5 cents 
														apiece. As time 
														progressed, Sean's 
														father gave him many 
														opportunities to express 
														the artistic side of his 
														character. His mother, 
														Diana, showed him the 
														world of the performing 
														arts; she taught music 
														at Southside Elementary 
														and used her summers to 
														create short films in 
														various countries of the 
														world.<br />
														<br />
														As Sean's art 
														progressed, he moved 
														from drawing cars to 
														people. At nine years 
														old, Sean had his first 
														art exhibit, a Father &amp; 
														Son Show at the Hilton 
														Leech Art gallery in 
														Sarasota, where his 
														drawings were purchased 
														by such luminaries as 
														famed author John D. 
														MacDonald and 
														photographer Jan 
														Silberstein.<br />
														<br />
														Throughout the ‘60s, his 
														father held summer art 
														workshops in places like 
														Canada and North 
														Carolina, Maine and 
														Mexico. These 
														environments filled Sean 
														with creative energy, 
														and he gradually moved 
														from drawing into 
														sculpture. He first 
														began working with clay, 
														making ceramic art 
														tiles, then evolved into 
														creating whimsical 
														bronze sculptures, These 
														small bronzes featured 
														imaginative things such 
														as cowboys riding 
														dolphins and whales 
														morphing into jet 
														airplanes.<br />
														<br />
														In 1970 and 1971 the 
														family traveled around 
														the world for fourteen 
														months, with his mother 
														making short 16mm films 
														for schools and 
														libraries. Sean would 
														star in one movie while 
														his brother would star 
														in the next. During 
														their extended travels, 
														they made films in 
														Kyoto, Hong Kong, 
														Sydney, Bali, Bangkok, 
														Katmandu and Old Delhi. 
														Sean and Kevin also 
														attended school in 
														Queensland, Australia 
														while their father 
														opened a bronze 
														sculpture foundry. Upon 
														leaving Australia, the 
														family traveled overland 
														from Nepal to London and 
														then back to the U.S.<br />
														<br />
														After graduating from 
														Sarasota High School in 
														1979, Sean started his 
														bronze casting supply 
														business
														<a href="http://www.shellspen.com/">
														www.Shellspen.com</a>. 
														He took a few college 
														courses, but left school 
														to partner with his 
														father in the bronze 
														foundry business in what 
														is now Sarasota's 
														Historic Rosemary 
														District. In the late ‘80s 
														he and his brother 
														joined forces with Drew 
														Truitt in a new business 
														in downtown Sarasota 
														called Colson Originals. 
														Here they reproduced 
														historic statuary for 
														the streets of Sarasota.<br />
														<br />
														In the early ‘90s, Sean 
														moved to Central Studios 
														on Central Avenue, 
														helping to develop an 
														enclave of local 
														artists. Here, he 
														continued to reproduce 
														historic Sarasota 
														statuary, and had a 
														visit from a relative of 
														Charles Ringling which 
														motivated him to expand 
														his line. The Ringling 
														Museum hired him to work 
														on repairing many of 
														their weathered pieces, 
														and he also worked with 
														his father on 
														maintenance of metal 
														sculptures belonging to 
														the City of Sarasota.<br />
														<br />
														This year, Sean 
														introduced Sarasota's 
														Ringling Isles Urn, a 
														piece which he and Ed 
														Pinto designed to 
														commemorate Sarasota's 
														rich history with John 
														Ringling. This stunning 
														piece is hand carved in 
														marble and is available 
														to order. It can be seen 
														at Sean's art website:
														<a href="index.html">
														www.ColsonCreations.com</a><br />
